* **Email subscription management** through [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/)
* **Mailing address validation** through the USPS
* **Geolocation and mapping** through Census data in the United States
* **Tagging** of membership records to indicate committees or extra data
* **Data exports** through an administrative tool

# Member Directory

Member Directory is a [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) 5 project to manage the membership records of a local chapter of a larger, national organization. It has a handful of useful features:

* **CSV imports** that update records based on a common identifier
* **CSV exports** for use in other systems or building call lists
* **Email subscription management** through [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/)
* **Mailing address validation** through the USPS
* **Geolocation and mapping** through Census data in the United States
* **Record history** for tracking changes to member records
* **Role-based access** for administrators to view directory or manage it
* **Tagging** of membership records to indicate committees or extra data
* **Donation tracking** via [Donorbox](https://donorbox.org) import or manual entry
* **Self-service record updates** via unique, one-time use URLs
* **Two-Factor Security** (optional) to help keep your member data safe
